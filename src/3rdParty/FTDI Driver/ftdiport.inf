; 1.2	In this Licence a "Genuine FTDI Component" means an item of hardware that was 
;		manufactured for, and sold by, the Licensor or a member of the Licensor's group of 
;		companies. It does not include any counterfeit or fake products. 
; 
; 1.3	If you are a manufacturer of a device that includes a Genuine FTDI Component (each a 
;		"Device") then you may install the Software onto that device. If you are a seller or distributor 
;		of a Device then you may distribute the Software with the Device. If you are a user of a 
;		Device then you may install the Software on the Device, or onto a computer system in order

; 1.5	The Software will not function properly on or with a component that is not a Genuine FTDI 
;		Component. Use of the Software as a driver for, or installation of the Software onto,  a 
;		component that is not a Genuine FTDI Component, including without limitation counterfeit 
;		components, MAY IRRETRIEVABLY DAMAGE THAT COMPONENT.  It is the Licensee's 
;		responsibility to make sure that all chips it installs the Software on, or uses the Software as a 
;		driver for, are Genuine FTDI Components. If in doubt then contact the Licensor.  
; 
; 2.	If a custom vendor ID and/or product ID or description string are used, it is the responsibility of 
;		the product manufacturer to maintain any changes and subsequent WHQL re-certification as 
;		a result of making these changes. 
; 
; 3.	LICENSEE'S UNDERTAKINGS

; 3.1	Except as expressly set out in this Licence or as permitted by any local law, you undertake:

; 
; 		3.1.4	not to disassemble, de-compile, reverse engineer or create derivative works based 
;				on the whole or any part of the Software;
