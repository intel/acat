    /// This is a sample sensor class.  This is the one that interacts
    /// with the sensor hardware, detects switch actuations and triggers.
    /// It then raises events indicating the type of switch activity.
    /// An example would be a camera sensor that detects facial gestures.
    /// It could detect multiple gestures such as a mouth twitch,
    /// cheek twitch, eyebrow raise, smile, frown etc and raise events
    /// indicating which type of gesture was detected.  
    /// Gestures can be mapped to actions.  The default gesture is a
    /// switch activation which selects the currently highlighted
    /// element in a swtich scanning interface.
    /// Each Gesture is treated as an actuator switch.  This is 
    /// analogous to assigning keyboard hot keys to actions.  Each
    /// hotkey can be treated as a switch, which when activated, 
    /// executes the assigned action.
    /// Mapping of switches to actions is done through two 
    /// actuator configuration files - Actuators.xml and SwitchConfigMap.xml.
    /// Refer to the ACAT Developer's Guide for details on these two files.
    /// 
    /// A Note about switch activity events:
    /// 
    /// Some sensors have the ability to detect a swtich-down and
    /// switch-up events, and some have the ability to just detect
    /// when a swtich was triggered. If your sensor is able to
    /// detect all three types of events, you must choose which ones
    /// you want to use.  You can't use all three.  You can eiter 
    /// choose to notify ACAT about:
    /// a) A swtich-down event followed by a swtich-up event
    ///       OR
    /// b) A switch trigger event.
    /// 
    /// Do NOT do both a) and b).
    /// 
    /// So in this class, you must either call:
    /// a) notifySensorActivate() followed by notifySensorDectivate
    ///        OR
    /// b) notifySensorTrigger()
